Space and time seem to emerge from nothingness, just as life and consciousness appear to arise from the non-living and non-conscious. The question of how complexity arises from simplicity is one of the deepest challenges in science and philosophy. My research focuses on unraveling this mystery—whether in physical, biological, or social systems—through both analytical and computational approaches. On the applied side, I leverage data-driven methods to tackle the toughest challenges faced by organizations of any scale.
