Complexity researcher and data scientist pursuing a PhD in computational sciences, combining theoretical physics, advanced data analysis, and philosophical insight to solve complex challenges in both research and industry. Scientific contributions include the discovery of a novel computational method for analysing complex systems, identification of a new physical phenomenon (the Spin-Glass Sponge), and uncovering previously unknown magnetic behaviour under external fields – all published in leading journals.

This deep analytical expertise has driven successful implementations of predictive models across various markets and quantum computing applications in portfolio optimisation and risk management. With more than five years of experience spanning academic and industrial settings, this work demonstrates the ability to transform sophisticated theoretical understanding into practical data-driven solutions.

Research explores how complexity emerges from simplicity in physical and social systems, while practical applications leverage these insights to tackle real-world challenges. This unique combination of scientific rigour and business acumen offers organisations a powerful approach to addressing their most complex data challenges.
