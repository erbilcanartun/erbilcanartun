Complexity researcher and data scientist pursuing a PhD in computational sciences, integrating theoretical physics, advanced data analytics, and philosophical frameworks to bridge the gap between fundamental research and practical innovation. 

Scientific contributions include the development of a new computational classification framework for analyzing emergent patterns in complex systems, identification of a new physical phenomenon (the Spin-Glass Sponge), and uncovering previously unknown behaviors in complex magnetic systems – all published in leading peer-reviewed journals. This deep analytical expertise has led to successful implementations of predictive modeling and risk management solutions across various markets, policy support systems for national regulatory authorities, and automated decision-making solutions for environmental protection agencies. With more than five years of experience spanning academic and industrial settings, this work demonstrates the ability to build and lead cross-functional teams that transform sophisticated theoretical insights into scalable data-driven solutions. 

Research investigates the fundamental principles of how complexity emerges from simplicity in physical and social systems, while practical applications leverage these insights to tackle real-world challenges in both business and public sectors. This unique combination of scientific research, entrepreneurial drive, and interdisciplinary perspective offers organizations of any scale a powerful approach to tackle their most complex data challenges with innovative solutions backed by systematic scientific methodology.
