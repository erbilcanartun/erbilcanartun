Complexity & Data Scientist pursuing a PhD in computational sciences, combining theoretical physics, advanced data analytics, and philosophical approaches to connect fundamental research with real-world applications. With more than five years of experience in academic and industrial settings, this work demonstrates the ability to build and lead diverse teams that transform theoretical insights into measurable business outcomes. 

Research investigates the fundamental principles of how complexity emerges from simplicity in physical and social systems, while practical applications leverage these insights to tackle real-world challenges in both the business and public sectors. This foundation offers organizations of any scale proven methods to tackle their toughest problems with data-driven solutions backed by systematic scientific methodology.
